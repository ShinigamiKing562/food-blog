        <h3>Here's how you make it:</h3>
        <h4>Step 1 Cream together oil and sugar and then blend with beaten eggs</h4>
        <p>Making a homemade sponge cake was never so easy. Begin by mixing sugar and olive oil together. Whisk well until light and fluffy with a manual whisker or a fork. Once done, add the beaten eggs and blend well. Beat further so that the mixture turns white and creamy.</p>
        <h4>Step 2 Combine flour mix and beaten eggs</h4>
        <p>Sift together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. It is done to evenly distribute the baking soda in flour. Gradually, add this to the egg mixture. If required, add a little milk and mix till the batter is fluffy and soft. You may not add the entire milk if you feel the consistency of your cake is fine and it pours down like canned condensed milk. Add vanilla essence and blend well. Vanilla essence is important to camouflage the smell of eggs and to make the cake taste delicious.</p>
        <h4>Step 3 Bake the cake as per your convenience</h4>
        <p>Now, take a baking tin to cook the cake and grease it well using some olive oil or cooking spray. Then, sprinkle some maida or all-purpose flour on it. It will prevent the cake from sticking to the base. You can also line it with butter paper so that when the cake is baked, it can be taken out easily. Pour the prepared cake batter into the prepared tin and place it on a stand in a pressure cooker. Do not add water to the cooker and ensure that the tin does not touch the base of the cooker. You can also keep the baking dish on an inverted steel plate. Increase the flame and pressure cook for two minutes. Now, remove the whistle and cook on low flame for 35-40 minutes. If you are using an electric oven, cook at 180 degrees for 30-35 minutes.</p>
