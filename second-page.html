        <h4>Step 4 Check with a knife or skewer if it is cooked and serve</h4>
        <p>Insert a knife or a metal skewer into the cake and if it comes out clean, then the cake is ready. Remove from the oven/cooker and allow to cool on a wire rack. This cooling process is done so that the cake doesn't break down in between and comes out nice and clean. Once cooled enough, turn the cake tin upside down to remove the cake. You can also use the butter paper to lift off the cake, but you have to be a pro to make it happen quickly as it can also break the cake. So, it's better to turn the tin upside down for a better cake. Before decorating, cut an even slice of the cake from the top to prevent any doomed top. But make sure you do this step when the cake is still warm and not completely cold. Now, take some whipping cream and line the cake with it evenly and scrape any extra cream. Once done, you can use cherries to decorate the cake or even tutti-frutti, it completely depends on your choice. The cake is ready now.</p>
        <h4>Step 5 How to make whipping cream</h4>
        <p>To make whipping cream for a cake at home, all you need is a mixing bowl, some heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract and an electric mixer. Take the bowl and add heavy whipping cream in it along with powdered sugar and vanilla extract in it. Whip them all together at medium-high speed. One must understand here that it should not be overdone. If the cream comes out grainy and curdled, it's a hint that you have over-whipped the cream. The soft whipping cream will be done in a few minutes, say about 2-3 minutes. Make sure to stop in between and check the consistency of the whipping cream. The perfect whipping cream will have a sturdy peak in it when lifted off. It should not be too soft or liquidy, and curdled or heavy. Once done, you can transfer in a cone as well to decorate your cake.</p>

        <ul class="tipslist">
            <li>For making Homemade Cake, make sure you whisk the cake mix well. And better use an electric blender for mixing all the ingredients, as this will make the mixture frothy and light.</li>
            <li>If you do not have olive oil at home, you can even use butter or ghee. Or you can use homemade white butter for extra flavour. </li>
